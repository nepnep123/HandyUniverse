Thanks for purchasing the Exo-planet pack !

Here are few notes concerning the asset :
- The shader is fully customizable (for the planet + the atmosphere) If your scene is a close up one or taken from far away, I strongly suggest you to adapt the settings to achieve the best visual result.

- In addition to the original 3D model, there is a low poly and high poly sphere at your disposal.

- For each planet you have access to :  
				- 2 Different night cities 
				- 3 different clouds	
				- 20 different set of textures

- The size of the planet is by default pretty big, but feel free to downsize them.

- By default , all planets are rotating, feel free to desactivate the animator component.

- By default, the max size of textures is set to 2048px, feel free to set them to 4096 if you need a close up.
